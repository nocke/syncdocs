### extremly simplified git versioning for non-technical users. <br>_“surviving your daily flood of bureaucratic cruft”_

<img src="./docs/img/syncDocsCover.jpg" alt="SyncDocs Cover Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

> `syncdocs` is **<ins>not</ins>** a tool to maintain any particular states of source code. (That's what `git` does...)
>
> This is a tool, that helks handling those incoming, ever-growing documents (i.e. invoices, notes, pdfs, bureaucractic cruft) in one central place, yet also decentralized, with offline access and syncing as a nobrainer.
>
> `syncdocs` has 1 end-user friendly command with 0 parameters to use. As much as I love git, no commit|pull|push|rebase and certainly no resolve-merge-conflicts makes things much easier for end users. Yet, it does harnesses many benefits of regular `git` use:
> * very easy syncing
> * versioning of course
> * largely conflict-free merges
> * rename detection (quite a feature actually!)
> * smart merging of anything plain-text (something-added-here vs. something-added-there in the same file will go together as you may expect)
> * some opinionated-ness, when non-text file changes collide (PDFs, images, …). spoiler: both versions will make it into recoverably version history)
> * recoverability (it doesn't matter if your server or client get's stolen or destroyed, as long as the-other-side is still around)
> * no system/platform/vendor-lock (all files are still in plain sight, in your file system, in a valid git repository, not buried in some fragile database, somewhere in the cloud, …)

## technical view

The idea being to sync personal data (text, pdf documents and invoices, screenshots, _not_ source code) between a central git repository (_actively usable_, not "bare", so truly peer-to-peer, which does brings some technical issues…) and various workstations with regular _client repos_

The idea being that your family members can also add stuff offline, i.e. on the road, and it all eventually ends up everywhere...

**Sounds like something `git` would do out of the box, right? Yeah, but...**

* central repo is editable, too, _not_ a pure-server “bare repo”
* **end-users get a single, zero-param `syncdocs` command, no pull, no add, no commit, no push, never to bother with merge conflicts**
* collisions in given usage scenarios shall be rare (it's mostly about adding cruft), but will occur: in which case _both_ versions are preserved in version history: the more central one “wins” as the latter version, the other one preserved underneath
* it's still valid git repos on all ends (no vendor/platform lock-in), so you can add/integrate further things (i.e. commit hooks to the server), or analyse/retrieve elder versions with regular git tools like my favourite, [smartgit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/).

## development

This initially developed as a shell script, but things got a bit more tricky on some edge cases, so robust testing definelty required. Sso this deserved a second look, proper package, proper testing to ensure integrity and reliabilty around a number of edge cases, primarily as most git users would guess: merging.

The plan is to deliver as an npm package, so it truly becomes yet-another command (w/o path fiddling).

## requirements

Presence of a sufficient node (≥v20) and git version (≥v2.2) is expected to be present (syncdocs doesn't install neither) and [checked on (every) script run](src/smokeCheck.js#L6).

## getting started

* install/check node / git version
